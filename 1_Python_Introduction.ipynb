Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.\n",

        "2. Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.\n",
        "Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.\n",

All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right. \n",
